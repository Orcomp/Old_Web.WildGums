            <p>At WildGums we have a robust Quality Assurance programme. We run all our modules through an extensive unit testing regime every time we change something. We also do hands on final product testing to make sure the user experience is up to quality.</p>

            <h3>Beta channel</h3>

            <p class="text-left">We also have a Beta channel for our products for those that want to be on the leading (sometimes bleeding) edge of the latest technology.</p>
            
            <p class="text-left"> The Beta channel allows you to get your hands on the latest updates and help us test them out before we release them to everyone else. The Beta channel comes with a very serious warning though, it may not work, that’s why it’s Beta. So be very careful if you choose this option.</p>

            <p>Despite all our efforts to get things right sometimes things can still go wrong. Don’t worry because at WildGums we have your “back”, literally.</p>

            <p>In all of our modules we have a rollback feature that keeps track of your previous version and if something goes wrong with an upgrade, you can easily rollback to the last working version.</p>
