            <p style="margin-top:20px;">One of the problems with applications where all the functions are wrapped into a single product is that you have to wait for the vendor to release a complete upgrade to the entire program in order to get an enhancement in one of the features. This also means that most business users have to go into a full “end to end” testing regime to ensure there are no “surprises” in other parts of the system.</p>
            <p>With our modular approach we can release an update to one of our modules without affecting any of the other modules. This reduces your testing workload and risk when taking an upgrade. It also means we can release upgrades more quickly.</p>
            <p>As long as you are under maintenance you can get these upgrades when you choose, or automatically with our inbuilt upgrade process. At WildGums the squirrels do the hard work of upgrading for you.</p>

                <p>Just click on the squirrel to restart the module and the updates are ready for you to use. Otherwise just wait until the next time you close and reopen the module, the new features will then be available for you.</p>
