            <h3>Standard Modules</h3>
            <p>We‘ve developed a suite of modules that cover a wide range of functions each in its own feature rich, easy to use environment that empowers our users to make better more informed decisions.</p>

                <p>While each of our modules is designed to be used as a stand-alone product, our modules are also designed to be flexibly combined into powerful software solutions</p>

                <p style="margin-top:20px;">All of these modules might sound like a bit of a nightmare to learn and manage, don’t worry at WildGums we have this covered too. All of our modules have the same look and feel so that you feel right at home no matter which module you’re using.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">We also have a “Product Suite” button built in so that you can easily switch between any WildGums modules you own.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Client Specific Modules</h3>
            <p>Some of our modules already have the concept of sector or client specific plug-ins so that they can deliver slightly different features for different end users. Sometime this still isn’t enough, or it may just be that we haven’t released a module yet for a requirement you have.</p>
            <p>At WildGums we’ve thought of this too. As well as providing our standard modules, our professional development team can create custom built applications for our clients that are robust, quality assured and follow all the same principles we build into our off the shelf solutions.</p> 
            <p>As well as having all the right stuff under the hood, our custom modules have the same look and feel as all our other modules so that you’ll feel comfortable and productive from day one.</p>
