Often these clients have more than one resource that they plan this way. As long as you are just considering the sequence of jobs on a single resource at a time, independently of any other resources in your facility then Factory Sequencer is right for you.</p><p>Factory sequencer has lots of functionality right off the shelf: minimising changeovers, drag and drop, sort and filter to name a few. It also has modules that have been developed for specific industry sectors like beverages and timber milling. We can also create Client specific modules that plug seamlessly into the Factory Sequencer user experience to ensure it does exactly what you need for your unique facility.</p>"

            <p>We‘ve developed a suite of modules that cover a wide range of functions each in its own feature rich, easy to use environment that empowers our users to make better more informed decisions.</p>
