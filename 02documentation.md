# Workspace Settings

A workspace allows you to:
- Configure the Gantt chart exactly the way you want it to look.
- Store all your settings under a convenient name.
- Switch settings quickly and easily.

Once a workspace is saved you can easily switch between different workspaces you have created.
When you select a workspace from the drop down box, all the settings for the workspace will be restored.

To create a new workspace:
- Enter a name in the text box and click on the create button.
- Make the changes you require on the Gantt chart.
- Click the save button.

New settings can be added to an existing workspace by clicking on the save button at any time.

NOTE: Please note all settings described on this page are optional.
